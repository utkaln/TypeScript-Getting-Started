# TypeScript-Getting-Started

This is the official repository for my Pluralsight course titled [*TypeScript: Getting Started*](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/typescript-getting-started/table-of-contents). 
The *main* branch contains code as it 
exists at the start of the course. There are separate branches named after the modules in the course that contain the code as it 
exists at the end of that module.

# Utkal Notes
